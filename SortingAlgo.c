  Analysis Criteria for Sorting Alogrithm

  1. Time Complexity
  2. Space Complexity
  3. Stability
  4. Internal Sorting Alogrithm -> All the data is loaded into the memory.
     External Sorting Alogrithm -> All the data is not loaded into the memory.
  5. Adaptive -> Already sorted takes less time.
  6. Recursive / Non Recursive -> Recursive if it was recursion.
